Spread 4.3.0  http://www.spread.org

Spread Concepts LLC is happy to announce the release of a 
new stable version, 4.3.0, of the Spread toolkit. 

The Spread 4.3 release is an important release focusing on improved out-of-the-box
performance for the Spread toolkit. 
This release has a large number of small changes which include bugfixes,
very specific performance improvements, and general improvements to the code 
and build process.

The main new features of this release are:

1) Performance improvements to membership timing and system throughput. 
2) Provide runtime configurability for membership timers and flow control 
parameters via the spread.conf file. 
3) Redesign of C library locking to improve throughput and remove blocking. 
4) Smarter autodetection of both the best client-server connection method 
(local system unix sockets or tcp) and the local hostname when starting daemons.

It also includes a number of bug fixes. For details check the Readme.txt file. 

This release does not include any API changes, so applications should
be able to be relinked or recompiled with the new Spread library without
changes. 

The Spread toolkit provides a high performance messaging service
that is resilient to faults across local and wide area networks.
Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, 
and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group communication, 
and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable messaging 
to fully ordered messages with virtual synchrony delivery guarantees, even in case 
of computer failures and network partitions.

Please be aware, that under the Spread Open Source License, the toolkit may 
be freely used only under some conditions. For example, the license includes 
the requirement that all advertising materials (including web pages) 
mentioning software that uses Spread display a specific acknowledgment. 
Please review the license agreement for more details.
